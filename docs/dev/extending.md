# Extending the App

Extending the application is welcome, however it is best to open an issue first, to ensure that a PR would be accepted and makes sense in terms of features and design.

## Customizing Onboarding Behavior With Extensions

This plugin provides methods to customize onboarding behavior. By creating onboarding extensions, it is possible to onboard switch stacks, HA pairs and perform other customizations.

Please see the dedicated FAQ for [device onboarding extensions](onboarding_extensions.md).
