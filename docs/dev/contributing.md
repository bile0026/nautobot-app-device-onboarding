# Contributing to the App

Pull requests are welcome and automatically built and tested against multiple version of Python and multiple version of Nautobot through GitHub Actions.

The project is packaged with a light [development environment](dev_environment.md) based on `docker-compose` to help with the local development of the project and to run tests.

The project is following Network to Code software development guidelines and is leveraging the following:

- Python linting and formatting: `black`, `pylint`, `bandit`, `flake8`, and `pydocstyle`.
- YAML linting is done with `yamllint`.
- Django unit test to ensure the plugin is working properly.

Documentation is built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The [Docker based development environment](dev_environment.md#docker-development-environment) automatically starts a container hosting a live version of the documentation website on [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) that auto-refreshes when you make any changes to your local files.

## Branching Policy
